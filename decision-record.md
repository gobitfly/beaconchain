# Decision Record 

## D-BC-001: conventinal commits for `commit message formatting`

### Status

proposed by @peterbitfly

### Context

At the moment commit messages are not formatted in a standard way.
This makes it harder to work together, e.g. when resolving `merge conflicts`, using `line blaming`, to `revert` a change or
understand the `history of the project`.

Especially to create `release notes`.

### Decision

We are using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for commit messages.

### Consequences

1. Commit messsages `MUST` be formatted in `conventional commits` style. 
1. Every change that belongs together `SHOULD` be part of `one commit`.
1. There `MUST NOT` be `commits` like `implement review feedback` or `make linter happy`.
1. Teams (e.g. frontend, backend, mobile) `SHOULD` come up with `guidelines` regarding:
    1. `types` (teams `SHOULD` stick to the [default set](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#type)) and
    1. `scopes`
1. One pull requesst `MAY` contain multiple commits.
1. Every `Pull Request` (opened by a `bitflyer`) `SHOULD` have one `commit` that has a `Footer` with an `issue number` (like BEDS-XXX).
1. Before `merging` into `staging` all commits `MUST` be `rebased` (will be enforced by project settings).
