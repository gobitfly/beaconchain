# Decision Record

## D-001: conventinal commits for `commit message formatting`

### Status

accepted by @MauserBitfly @benji-bitfly @marcel-bitfly

### Context

At the moment commit messages are not formatted in a standard way.
This makes it harder to work together, e.g. when resolving merge conflicts.

### Decision

We are using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for commit messages.

### Consequences

Commit messsages will be formatted in a standard way.

- which will reduce the cognitive load
  - as it is easier to understand `code changes`, e.g. when `line blaming`
  - as it is easier to formulate meaningful `commit messages`
- it will beeasier to understand the history of the project
- changelog could be `autogenerated`
